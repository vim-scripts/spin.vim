This is a syntax file for the Spin language, designed by Parallax for the Propeller microcontroller ("http://www.parallax.com/tabid/407/Default.aspx&quot;). Now there's cross-platform command line tools to upload your Spin programs to the Propeller, so you don't need the Propeller IDE (and hence, Windows) to use it. 

I based this syntax file on the syntax file for the Python language, since the languages have certain similarities.
